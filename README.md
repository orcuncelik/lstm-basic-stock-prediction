# lstm-basic-stock-prediction
This project leverages the power of LSTM networks to predict future stock prices (can be aplicable to crypto markets as well). 
Given historical stock price data, the model is trained to understand patterns in the time-series data. This understanding is then used to predict future stock prices.
